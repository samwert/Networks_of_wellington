			<h1>DRAINS</h1>
			<p>This network covers the fact that all drains and streets are designed to lead to a centre point where water can be funnelled through to water treatment places.What I wanted to take photos of is the drains that help guid them to there place.The network here is the path they take from a suburb traveling underground and going across all of wellington to get to this centeralised point. </p>

			<h1>SENSORS</h1>
			<p>I liked this idea of sensors due to the fact that I didnt notice how many sensors were around the place especially in town.The dense area of population and shops sees an increase amount of sensors.This network looks at the density based on population and the reach around wellington it has spanning from all places from the Hutt to the city to Porirua. </p>

			<h1>WATERWORKS</h1>
			<p>These network works similar to the draining system .But the fact that this entrance is sort of used to test the water.The point of entry differs in looks based on time that has past.What I wanted to look at was the different styles but essentially the same function.The network I was looking at was the same as the drains was the connectivity of water under ground.</p>

			<h1>PHONEBOOTH</h1>
			<p>This network is more along the lines of the internet,focusing on wifi.On these phone booths it is interesting to see how far they have come from just a telephone to becoming a hotspot or free wifi.</p>
